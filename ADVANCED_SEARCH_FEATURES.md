1. **Extended Type System**
   ```typescript
   interface SearchFilters {
     query: string
     location?: string
     language?: string
     minFollowers?: number
     maxFollowers?: number
     minRepos?: number
     maxRepos?: number
     accountType?: 'user' | 'org'
     createdBefore?: string
     createdAfter?: string
     sort?: 'followers' | 'repositories' | 'joined'
     order?: 'asc' | 'desc'
   }
   ```

2. **Enhanced GitHub API Integration**
   - Advanced query building with GitHub search syntax
   - Support for complex filter combinations
   - Optimized API calls with proper caching

3. **New React Hooks**
   - `useAdvancedSearchUsers`: Main search hook with filter support
   - `useLanguageSuggestions`: Programming language autocomplete
   - `useLocationSuggestions`: Location-based suggestions

4. **Modular Component Architecture**
   - `AdvancedSearchForm`: Main search interface
   - `FilterChips`: Visual filter management
   - Reusable form controls and validation

### üîß **GitHub API Query Building**

The system intelligently builds GitHub search queries using their advanced search syntax:

```
// Example generated query:
"john location:\"San Francisco\" language:JavaScript followers:100..1000 repos:>=10 type:user created:>=2020-01-01"
```

### ‚ö° **Performance Optimizations**

1. **Smart Caching Strategy**
   - 5-minute cache for search results
   - 24-hour cache for language suggestions
   - 10-minute cache for location suggestions

2. **Debounced Suggestions**
   - Prevents excessive API calls during typing
   - Smooth user experience with instant feedback

3. **Optimized Re-renders**
   - Efficient state management with React Hook Form
   - Minimal re-renders during filter changes

## Usage Examples

### üéØ **Common Search Scenarios**

1. **Find JavaScript Developers in San Francisco**
   ```
   Location: San Francisco
   Language: JavaScript
   Sort by: Followers (Descending)
   ```

2. **Discover New Go Contributors**
   ```
   Language: Go
   Min Repositories: 5
   Joined After: 2022-01-01
   Sort by: Repositories (Descending)
   ```

3. **Find Influential Python Developers**
   ```
   Language: Python
   Min Followers: 1000
   Account Type: User
   Sort by: Followers (Descending)
   ```

4. **Explore Organizations in Berlin**
   ```
   Location: Berlin
   Account Type: Organization
   Sort by: Repositories (Descending)
   ```

## Filter Combinations

The system supports powerful filter combinations:

- **Location + Language**: Find React developers in London
- **Followers + Repositories**: Find active developers with good following
- **Date Range + Language**: Find new developers learning specific technologies
- **Location + Account Type**: Find companies or individual developers in specific regions
